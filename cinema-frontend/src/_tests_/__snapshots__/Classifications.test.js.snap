            Universal - Suitable for all
          </h3>
          <p>
            A U film should be suitable for audiences aged four years and over, although it is impossible to predict what might upset any particular child. U films should be set within a positive framework and should offer reassuring counterbalances to any violence, threat or horror. If a work is particularly suitable for pre-school children, this will be indicated in the Ratings Info.

                Potentially dangerous behaviour must be clearly disapproved of. No emphasis on realistic or easily accessible weapons.

                References to illegal drugs or drug misuse must be infrequent and innocuous, or have a clear educational purpose or anti-drug message.

              <li>
                Infrequent use only of very mild bad language.

                Occasional nudity, with no sexual context.
              </li>
              <li>
                Scary or potentially unsettling sequences should be mild, brief and unlikely to cause undue anxiety. The outcome should be reassuring.
              </li>
              <li>
                Violence will generally be very mild. Mild violence may be acceptable if it is justified by context (for example, comedic, animated, wholly unrealistic).

          <p>
            General viewing, but some scenes may be unsuitable for young children. A PG film should not unsettle a child aged around eight or older. Unaccompanied children of any age may watch, but parents are advised to consider whether the content may upset younger, or more sensitive, children.

            12A/12 – Suitable for 12 years and over
          </h3>
          <p>
            Films classified 12A and video works classified 12 contain material that is not generally suitable for children aged under 12. No one younger than 12 may see a 12A film in a cinema unless accompanied by an adult. Adults planning to take a child under 12 to view a 12A film should consider whether the film is suitable for that child. To help them decide, we recommend that they check the Ratings Info for that film in advance. No one younger than 12 may rent or buy a 12 rated video work.
